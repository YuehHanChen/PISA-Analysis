# PISA Data Exploration
## by Yueh-Han Chen


## Dataset

> PISA is a survey of students' skills and knowledge as they approach the end of compulsory education. It is not a conventional school test. Rather than examining how well students have learned the school curriculum, it looks at how well prepared they are for life beyond school. Around 510,000 students in 65 economies took part in the PISA 2012 assessment of reading, mathematics and science representing about 28 million 15-year-olds globally. Of those economies, 44 took part in an assessment of creative problem solving and 18 in an assessment of financial literacy.

## File Explanation
- The main analysis file is PISA_Data_exploration.ipynb
- The final visualization file is PISA_slide.slides.html (you can download it to see the results in slides.)

## Summary of Findings

> 1.Students with internet tend to get lower final weights, whose median is around 12, but students' without internet at home have medium final weights of 20.

> 2.Students typically got higher final weigts when they spent more time studying out of school, but when they studied beyond 70 hours, their final weight started to decrease. Students with 70 hours study time out of school got the highest average final weight.

> 3.Male students tend to spend time between 1 to 10 hours studying out of school, but female students tend to spend time between 3 to 10 hours studying out of school

> 4.Students with pocitive attitude towards school tend to be willing to spend more time studing, which leads to higher weights.

> 5.Students who have not or do not use internet got at least 10 final weights higher than those who have and use it. And they usually are positive towards school.

> 6.parents that only mom had studied in college tend to lead their kids got higher final weight.

## Key Insights for Presentation

> 1.Students who use internet tend to get average 11 final weights lower than those who do not use or do not have internet.

> 2.Students with strongly positive attitude towards school got average 4 final weight higher than those students with negative attitude.

> 3.Students typically got higher final weigts when they spent more time studying out of school, but when they studied beyond 70 hours, their final weight started to decrease. Students with 70 hours study time out of school got the highest average final weight.

> 4.In terms of whether their parents had studied in college affect their final weight, I found that only mom had studied in college tend to lead their kids got 10 final weight higher than only dad, and 11 final weight higher than both, and 3 final weight higher than none.
